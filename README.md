Explanation of main.tf file:

1. **Data Sources: AWS AMI and VPC**
   
   ```hcl
   data "aws_ami" "app_ami" {
     ...
   }
   ```

   This block fetches the ID of a specific Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which is a pre-configured virtual machine image. The filters ensure that we get the most recent image with a specific naming pattern and that it's an HVM virtualization type. The "data" keyword denotes this is a data source, not a direct resource.

   ```hcl
   data "aws_vpc" "default" {
     default = true
   }
   ```

   This block fetches the ID of the default Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in your AWS environment. VPCs allow you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud.

2. **AWS Instance Resource**

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_instance" "blog" {
     ...
   }
   ```

   This block provisions an EC2 instance. The keyword "resource" indicates we're creating or managing an infrastructure resource. 
   
   - `ami`: Specifies which AMI to use for the instance. We refer to the data source for the AMI we fetched earlier.
   - `instance_type`: Refers to the type or size of the instance, like `t2.micro`, which is passed as a variable.
   - `vpc_security_group_ids`: List of security groups to be associated with the instance. Here, we reference the security group defined later in the file.
   - `tags`: Assigns a name tag to the instance.

3. **AWS Security Group Resource**

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_security_group" "blog" {
     ...
   }
   ```

   A security group acts as a virtual firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic. 

   - `name`: Specifies the name of the security group.
   - `description`: A brief description of the security group.
   - `vpc_id`: Associates the security group with a specific VPC. Here, we reference the default VPC we fetched earlier.

4. **AWS Security Group Rules**

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_security_group_rule" "blog_http_in" {
     ...
   }
   ```

   Security group rules define the allowed or denied traffic. The above rule allows inbound HTTP traffic on port 80.

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_security_group_rule" "blog_https_in" {
     ...
   }
   ```

   Similarly, this rule allows inbound HTTPS traffic on port 443.

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_security_group_rule" "blog_everything_out" {
     ...
   }
   ```

   This rule permits all outbound traffic from the instance.

For each of these blocks:

- The first quoted string following the block keyword (`data` or `resource`) is the **type** of resource we're working with. This is intrinsic to the kind of cloud resource you want and cannot be changed.
  
- The second quoted string is the **local name** for this resource. It's how you will refer to this particular resource block elsewhere in your Terraform code.

- Inside the block `{...}` are the **configuration arguments** for the resource. The specific arguments and their meanings differ between types of resources. 

In summary, this Terraform script will:
1. Fetch information about a specific AMI and default VPC.
2. Create an EC2 instance using the fetched AMI.
3. Create a security group and attach it to the instance.
4. Define rules in the security group to allow inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic and allow all outbound traffic.
